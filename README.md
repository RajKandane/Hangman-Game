# Hangman-Game

Hangman Game
Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing game implemented using HTML, PHP, and CSS. The game randomly selects a word from a list of words and allows the player to guess individual letters by clicking on them. The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the word correctly, represented by a gallows image. If the player fails to guess the word within the given attempts, the game is lost.

How to Play
Clone the repository to your local machine or access the live version on GitHub Pages (optional).
Run the index.html file in your browser or open the GitHub Pages link to start the game.
The game will display a gallows image with a series of underscores representing the letters of the word to guess.
Click on the letters you want to guess one by one. If the letter is correct, it will be revealed in the word. If not, a part of the gallows image will be drawn.
Continue guessing letters until you either guess the word correctly or run out of attempts.
If you guess the word correctly within the allowed attempts, you win! Otherwise, you lose.
