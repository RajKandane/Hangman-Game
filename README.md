## How to Play

1. The game will choose a random word from a list of words.

3. If the guessed letter is correct, it will be revealed in the word.
4. If the guessed letter is incorrect, a part of the hanging man will be drawn.
5. The player has 6 chances to guess the word correctly before the hanging man is completed.
6. The player can use the "Hint" button to reveal some letters in the word if they are stuck.
7. The game ends when the player either guesses all the letters correctly or runs out of chances.
